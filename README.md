# Finance Management Application

## Our journey 
The task of the project was to create an application. To gain more experience in app development, 
we ran an app idea brainstorming session. Our team decided to create a mobile application for monitoring 
finances. We did a review of other apps with similar functionality and also a poll among people to 
identify the main functionality and goals of the app. We created the design ourselves, and also tested 
it on real people, which allowed us to fix bugs. Finally, we started development. To create our 
application we chose the "Android Studio" environment and the Kotlin language. 

We came up with an application that is used to record and monitor user's goals and transactions with the possibility of adding custom categories.

You can read the application development process and technical documentation in the documentation folder. 

## My part
I have been responsible for setting and monitoring the financial goals.

According to SCRUM principle User can add, edit and delete goals. To each goal User can add, edit and delete saving. 

Each goal has a cash limit and a deadline. When one of them is reached, the ability to add saves is removed and the User is notified.
The User also has access to a percentage scale for each goal, for better interaction with the numbers.

Here is a visualization of the functionality of my part of the appliance.
